# Introduction
This <b>smart contract</b> was written with ```solidity```, ```hardhat```, ```Pinata``` and on  ```Polygon```. It's has features such as:
- Creating of Health Center profile.
- Enabling Ratings and Review
- Ability for users to know Hospitals near them with coordinates


# Technologies Used

- Polygon Testnet
- Pinata
- Solidity
- QuikNode



# Documentation
> About BriskMed
### Problem
Emergency Patients die everyday due to arriving in a filled HealthCare Centers with no capacity to admit or hospital with different area of specialty.

### Solution

- Users give rating just by connecting wallet
- Only Hospitals can create a profile
- Quick Hospital search.



## Issues and What I Learnt
> I ran into some issues some issues like. 
- Returning a mapping in solidity, which I finally resolved to return a struct.
- Verifying my smart contract where I could not paste a code if I import a library as a single file.
- Ethers as when I reload a page I get "INVALID address ENS name error" which was fixed by properly using the useeffect.â€‹

> Some of what we learnt.
- Proper use of for loop in solidity.
- Usage of `EthersJS to interact with smart contract which include reading and writing, items like signers and providers.

> Instructors were there to guide me through it and the bootcamp was of great Value.
